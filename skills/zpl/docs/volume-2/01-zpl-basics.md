<!-- image -->

This section provides basic information about Zebra Programming Language II (ZPL II).

ZPL II is a powerful label-definition and printer-control language. Labels may be defined in ZPL II and generated by a host computer system. A commercial label preparation system or a software package that automatically generates ZPL II code also may be used. For information about label preparation systems, consult your distributor, systems integrator, or computer software vendor.

## How ZPL II Differs from ZPL

ZPL II substantially reduces the time between when a printer begins receiving label format data and when the first label begins to print. This was accomplished primarily by changing the way ZPL scripts are written.

ZPL II scripts are not 100 percent compatible with standard ZPL scripts. However, the differences between ZPL II and standard ZPL scripts are minor. Most existing standard ZPL scripts can be modified easily to take advantage of ZPL II. You can also write ZPL II scripts that are compatible with standard ZPL printers.

These are the major differences between ZPL and ZPL II:

- With ZPL II, all data fields are formatted as they are received. In standard ZPL, the data fields are not processed until after the ^XZ (End Format) command is received.
- Many new commands and significant enhancements to existing commands were added into the ZPL II language.

To take advantage of ZPL II, the following ZPL II commands, if used, must come before the first ^FD (Field Data) command in a label format. If these commands are not placed before the first ^FD command, the label may not print correctly.

ZPL II commands can be entered in either uppercase characters, lowercase characters, or a combination of both.

## ZPL II Overview

ZPL II is Zebra Technologies Corporation's registered trademark for its Zebra Programming Language II. ZPL II commands sent to a Zebra printer give you the ability to create a wide variety of labels from the simple to the very complex. The labels can include any combination of text, bar codes, and graphics.

ZPL II contains a variety of printable character font styles and bar codes. Various ZPL II commands let you position print fields anywhere on a label horizontally or rotated 90, 180, or 270 degrees clockwise. Graphic images can be read and interpreted, provided that they are in a binary or hexadecimal format. Therefore, if you can convert a scanned or computer-generated image (an image created using a draw or paint software program) into hexadecimal format, you can print it on a label. You can use the ZTools™ for Windows program (available from Zebra) to convert the bitmap graphic into the pure hexadecimal graphic format.

ZPL II commands consist of a prefix character, a two-character mnemonic code, and where applicable, a parameter string. The entire language is programmable in printable ASCII characters, which allows easy passage of formats and data through computer networks and protocol converters. ZPL II commands do not use escape sequences or control codes. A few commands do have ASCII control code equivalents, which are noted as they apply.

ZPL II is both powerful and flexible, providing all of the following features:

- compatibility with PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers and networks
- serialized label fields, with user-selected starting value and increment/decrement value
- programmable label replicate count, batch quantity control, and printer pauses that enable batching of labels into usable groups
- simple line graphics to eliminate label preprinting
- scalable fonts
- bitmap image graphics, with library function capability (to store more than one graphic and recall as needed), for freeform graphic designs

You can create and use ZPL II scripts (label formats) one at a time from any word processor capable of generating an ASCII text file. You can integrate your Zebra printer into your operations by using database programs and other languages to generate ZPL II programs. The ZPL II program is then sent to the Zebra printer through an appropriate interface (combination of proper cabling, printer configuration, and software settings). The examples in this guide use printable ASCII characters in all commands, unless otherwise noted.

## Format and Control Commands

There are two different types of ZPL II commands:

- Format commands use the caret ( ^ ) prefix. The caret ( ^ ) is a single printable ASCII character having the code 5E HEX or 94 decimal. An 'RS' (HEX 1E) can be substituted for the caret ( ^ ).
- In ZPL II commands, the caret ( ^ ) is treated as an ordinary ASCII character. In this manual, when you see the caret ( ^ ), it indicates that you are to type the caret ( ^ ) character. The caret ( ^ ) character is not to be confused with pressing the Control (Ctrl) key on the keyboard.
- Control commands use the tilde ( ~ ) prefix. The tilde ( ~ ) is a single printable ASCII character having the code 7E HEX or 126 decimal. A 'DLE' (HEX 10) can be substituted for the tilde ( ~ ).

A few ZPL II commands can be sent to the printer as either a format command or a control command . The action performed by the printer will be the same in either case. These commands must be preceded by the appropriate prefix ( ^ or ~ ) for the context in which they are used. For example, the prefix characters for format ( ~ ) and control ( ^ ) commands can be changed using ZPL II the following commands:

- ^CT or ~CT (change tilde)
- ^CC or ~CC (change caret)

## Format Commands

Format commands are the blueprint of a label. These commands define label length, field origin, type of field, field data, and other information. Format commands are always preceded by the caret ( ^ ) character.

All format commands are processed in the order received, and most format commands are 'order-independent.' For example, commands to print text at the bottom of a label can come before the command to print a bar code at the top of the same label. However, some format commands must be placed before others within the label format. These are:

- ^LH (label home)
- ^LL (label length)
- ^LR (label reverse)
- ^LS (label shift)
- ^JM (set dots/millimeter)
- ^PM (mirror image)
- ^PO (print orientation)
- ^PF (slew dot rows)

Proper usage of these commands is explained in ZPL II Programming Guide Volume One .

Multiple label formats are processed in the order the printer receives them. Format commands fall into several categories:

- format bracket commands
- label definition commands
- field definition commands
- field default commands
- format default commands
- format rotation commands
- printer control commands
- alphanumeric field commands
- bar code field commands
- graphic image commands

## Control Commands

Control commands are usually preceded by a tilde ( ~ ) character. In most cases, these commands cause the printer to take a specific action immediately, such as clearing the memory or feeding a blank label. Control commands may interrupt and preempt any format commands waiting in the printer's received data buffer.

## Command Parameters and Default Values

Many ZPL II commands have parameter strings associated with them. Changing the value of one or more of these parameters affects the outcome of the printed label.

If the default value for a command parameter works well for the code you are writing, you do not need to specify that parameter. However, parameters are 'position-specific.' For example, if you want to change only the third parameter, you must indicate which parameter to change. To do so, use a comma (the ZPL II delimiter character) to mark each parameter's place. The code below sets the third parameter:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

If you enter a parameter, all further parameters to the right are defaulted; no further commas are required.

Some commands include the following abbreviation: {I.V.P. =} This signifies the Initial Value at Power-up, regardless of the value when the printer was turned off.

To permanently save configuration settings in the printer's configuration memory; send a ^JUS command at the end of the ZPL II script. For more information on using the ^JU command, refer to ZPL II Programming Guide Volume One .

## Example of a Basic Label

This example shows the basic steps to create a common label that contains text and a bar code. Type the programming commands (shown in bold) in the order given. An explanation of what each command does is in brackets [ ]. Figure 1 shows a printed example of the label and shows the ZPL II commands that generated each feature.

## ^XA

[^XA indicates start of label format.]

## ^LH30,30

[^LH sets label home position 30 dots to the right and 30 dots down from the top edge of the label.]

## ^FO20,10^AD^FDZEBRA^FS

```
[^FO20,10 sets the field origin 20 dots to the right and 10 dots down from the home position defined by the ^LH command.] [^AD - Select font 'D.'] [^FD - Start of field data.] [ZEBRA - Actual field data.] [^FS - End of field data.] ^FO20,60^B3^FDAAA001^FS [^FO20,60 - Set field origin 20 dots to the right and 60 dots down from the home position defined by the ^LH command.] [ ^B3 - Select Code 39 bar code.] [ ^FD - Start of field data for the bar code.] [ AAA001 - Actual field data.] [^FS - End of field data.] ^XZ [ ^XZ - Indicates end of label format.]
```

## Shortcuts for Writing ZPL II Scripts

ZPL II programming scripts can be written in a variety of ways. There are, however, more efficient ways to write a ZPL II script depending on the application and the commands used. The following are different ways to write the same ZPL II scripts, each yielding the same results.

## Writing Code on One Line and Using Parameter Defaults

A Code 39 bar code ( ^B3 ) example can have the ZPL II script written as:

```
^XA^FO100,75^BY3 ^B3N,N,100,Y,N ^FD123ABC^XZ
```

However, because it contains only one field, the entire command can be written as a one-line entry:

```
^XA^FO100,75^BY3^B3N,N,100,Y,N^FD123ABC^XZ
```

This script can be further simplified by using just the comma (,) delimiter to indicate default parameters in the ^B3 command. Leaving off the last two values indicates that default parameters are to be used at the end of the ^B3 command:

^XA^FO100,75^BY3 ^B3,,100 ^FD123ABC^XZ

<!-- image -->

## Eliminating Unnecessary Field Separators

You can write your ZPL II scripts in any way that makes sense to you. Some programmers prefer to write out each format command and field on a separate line like this:

```
^XA ^PR2^FS ^LL935^FS ^LH30,30^FS ^FO20,10^AF^FDZEBRA^FS ^FO20,60^B3,,40^FDAA001^FS ^FO20,180^AF^SNSERIAL NUMBER 00000000111,1,Y^FS ^PQ10^FS ^XZ
```

Although this script will print with no problems, it contains unnecessary ^FS (Field Separator) commands after the format commands. Some programmers feel that it is required to place a ^FS command at the end of each line, but the ^FS command is only needed to separate specific fields. Therefore, the script would transmit more quickly written this way:

```
^XA ^PR2 ^LL935 ^LH30,30 ^FO20,10^AF^FDZEBRA^FS ^FO20,60^B3,,40^FDAA001^FS ^FO20,180^AF^SNSERIAL NUMBER 00000000111,1,Y^FS ^PQ10 ^XZ
```

Other programmers prefer to keep the format commands on one line as an organizational preference, like this:

```
^XA^PR2^LL935^LH30,30 ^FO20,10^AF^FDZEBRA^FS ^FO20,60^B3,,40^FDAA001^FS ^FO20,180^AF^SNSERIAL NUMBER 00000000111,1,Y^FS ^PQ10^XZ
```

The label will print out the same, so you should develop a scripting pattern that suits your own organizational style but one that is efficient and keeps transmission times to a minimum.

## Font Shortcuts

There are times when you might include a specific font into your script and use it repeatedly within different fields. The following is an example of one way to write this script:

```
^XA ^FO120,108^A0N,89^FDA Guide to^FS ^FO120,207^A0N,89^FDZPL II^FS ^FO120,306^A0N,89^FDProgramming^FS ^FO120,405^A0N,89^FDLanguage^FS ^XZ
```

Notice that the ^FS command is used on the second to last line to close the field. Actually, it is unnecessary because the ^XZ will accomplish the same thing, so we can remove it from our script. Also, because the font and font size are not changing within the fields, this script can be simplified for quicker transmission by removing the unnecessary font entries and listing the font information once using the ^CF command:

```
^XA ^CF0,89 ^FO120,108^FDA Guide to^FS ^FO120,207^FDZPL II^FS ^FO120,306^FDProgramming^FS ^FO120,405^FDLanguage ^XZ
```

This script can be made even more efficient by including the ^FB command to identify the left origin of the text, which occurs at the same place each time:

```
^XA ^CF0,89 ^FO120,108 ^FB300,4 ^FDA Guide to\&ZPL II\&Programming\&Language ^XZ
```

Note · The entries '\&amp;' within the text indicate a carriage return/line feed as allowed by the ^FB command.

If you wanted to change the font type or size within the script, however, you would need to include the specific font parameters within the field where the change occurs. In this case, you would not want to use the ^FB command because the change in font size (in our example below) will affect the y-axis (up and down) position of the text. You can still use the ^CF command, but you will need to include the specific font information on the line where the change in the field occurs:

```
^XA ^CF0,89 ^FO120,108^FDA Guide to^FS ^FO120,207^FDZPL II^FS ^FO120,306^A0N,110^FDProgramming^FS ^FO120,426^FDLanguage ^XZ
```

## Using Device and Object Names

This section describes how device and object names can be used with commands that have a name parameter.

## Device Names

Device names have been assigned to the various printer memory devices (such as the DRAM, RAM, EPROM) to allow for easy identification of the devices. Using device names allows for storage, recall, copy, and deletion of ZPL II objects (for example, graphic images, label formats, and downloaded fonts) to and from specific areas.

A device name is a single letter followed by a colon. The printer devices are:

- R: Printer DRAM library (read/write)
- B: Optional memory (a card or factory installed)
- E: Flash memory (read/write)
- Z: Internal ZPL II stored object library (read only)

When recalling objects, the following search priority is used: DRAM, RAM, extra EPROM, internal ZPL II ( R: , B: , E: , Z: , * or ? (All)).

Several ZPL II commands use device names as an optional parameter. The default value may vary with the individual ZPL II commands. The default for the creation and deletion of objects is printer DRAM.

For more information about memory devices, see Memory, Flash Cards, and Font Cards on page 56.

## Object Names and Extensions

Each ZPL II object (graphic image, label format, downloaded font) must have a name. This name consists of two parts: an Object Name and an Extension. Object names can be 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters in length. Extensions consist of a period followed by 3 predefined characters. Object name conventions and extensions are similar to MS-DOS file name conventions and extensions.

Several ZPL II commands use these object names. Object names have no default and must be supplied. Extensions have the defaults defined below. Depending on the ZPL II command, if an extension is missing, incomplete, or incorrect, a default will be used. Defined extensions for ZPL II Object names, along with their related ZPL II commands are:

- Zebra bitmap format ( ~DG , ^IS , ^IL , ^XG or ^IM )
- .ZPL ZPL II label format ( ^DF or ^XF ) .FNT fonts in Zebra format ( ~DB or ~DS ) .GRF

Depending on the ZPL II command, the Object name and Extension may support the use of the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) as wild cards.

## Name Parameter

The device names and object names just described can be used with ZPL II commands that support a name parameter. The commands are:

- ~DG Download Graphic Image
- ^XG Recall Graphic Image
- ^IS Store format as a graphic image
- ^IL Load Image
- ^IM Move Image
- ^DF Store ZPL II format as text
- ^XF Recall ZPL II format
- ^ID Image Delete
- ^HW Host Directory List
- ^WD Print Directory
- ~DB Download Bitmap
- ~DS Download Scalable Font

The name parameter can consist of an alphanumeric string of from 1 to 8 characters or of a string containing a Device Name followed by an Object Name with an Extension. Defaults and/or use of the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) as wild cards will be defined with the individual command.
