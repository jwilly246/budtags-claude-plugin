## AIM Contact Information

<!-- image -->

This section provides contact information for AIM (Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility).

AIM is the global trade association for the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) industry, representing manufacturers, consultants, system integrators, and users involved in technologies that include bar code, RFID, card technologies, biometrics, RFDC, and their associated industries. AIM is the global source for technically accurate, unbiased, commercialfree and up-to-date information on all AIDC.

AIM is a developer of technical standards relevant to automatic identification and data capture techniques. There are different organizations that release bar code standards such as ANSI, UCC, ISS, USS, etc., but AIM Inc. has publications available on all the bar codes listed in this ZPL II Programming Guide. By contacting AIM Inc., you can get, from one source, all the specifications you need for your bar coding application. Besides bar code standards, AIM also has other valuable information such as books and video tapes relevant to the AIDC industry.
